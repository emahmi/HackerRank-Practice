There are 6 possibilities on each die. On 2 dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possibilities<br>
Possibility whose sum is 9 = 
‌‌ ‌‌‌‌‌ {{3,1}, {3,2}, {3,3}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {3,6},
   {4,1}, {4,2}, {4,3}, {4,4}, {4,5}, {4,6},
‌‌‌   {5,1}, {5,2}, {5,3}, {5,4}, {5,5}, {5,6},
‌‌‌ ‌  {6,1}, {6,2}, {6,3}, {6,4}, {6,5}, {6,6}}

There are 6 cases where sum >= 10: (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)<br>
This gives us probability(sum >= 10) = 6/36 = 1/6<br>
That means probability(sum <= 9) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6

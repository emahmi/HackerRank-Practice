There are 6 possibilities on each die. On 2 dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possibilities
Possibility whose sum is 6 = 
‌‌ ‌‌‌‌‌ {{3,1}, {3,2}, {3,3}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {3,6},
   {4,1}, {4,2}, {4,3}, {4,4}, {4,5}, {4,6},
‌‌‌   {5,1}, {5,2}, {5,3}, {5,4}, {5,5}, {5,6},
‌‌‌ ‌  {6,1}, {6,2}, {6,3}, {6,4}, {6,5}, {6,6}}
There are 4 cases that match the desired criteria: (1,5) (5,1) (2,4) (4,2)

This gives us a probability of 4/36 = 1/9
